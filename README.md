<h1>Echos Of Fate</h1>
<p>was our attempt at recreating the challenging but satisfying gameplay of the soulslike genre. As a team of three programmers we put this experience together in approximately three months. Taking inspiration from some of our favorite souls games like elden ring and the dark souls franchise, we designed our maps, boss mechanics and player controls to reflect this.</p>

<p>The game is divided into four unique levels each with their own theme and related boss fight. Gameplay is fast and simple, in the same style as a boss rush. The player will move through each level, clearing out fodder enemies and saving at checkpoints before eventually reaching and defeating the boss to move onto the next level.</p>
